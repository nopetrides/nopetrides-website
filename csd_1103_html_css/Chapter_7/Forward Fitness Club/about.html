                <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
                <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do
                    as
                    part
                    of their daily exercise routine.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Burpee</dt>
                    <dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength
                        and
                        endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and
                        extend
                        your
                        hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly,
                        and
                        then jump up from a squatted position.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Plank</dt>
                    <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push
                        up
                        position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as
                        long as
                        you can.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
                    <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on
                        the
                        floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest
                        and
                        then
                        switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a
                        mountain).
