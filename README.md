# nopetrides-website
Repository of my website project.

This website was created by Noah Petrides and was made as a portfolio site to demo the games and project I have worked on.

It is based on Noel Berry's website found at noelberry.ca
He has his website on GitHub but it is uses advanced tools and I wanted to instead create a website uses the basics of HTML and CSS to learn them. Check out his repo at https://github.com/NoelFB

My web developer friend Christopher Law was a big hand explaining some of the basics of web development. Check out his GitHub at https://github.com/Christopher-Law
